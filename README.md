CODE ESCAPE GAME

// Project Description

Our first group project in our 4th week at #76 and #79 Bootcamp @ Porto. We were challenged to create a game applying the technologies we had learned the previous weeks. Deadline for project deployment: 10 nights!

// The Idea

After our brainstorm, we chose to create a game of our everyday life like <CodeCadet>. The game revolves around our central character who tries to catch or escape obstacles thrown by Mcâ€™s. Good obstacles give you more points and bad ones take lives. Cautions: if the good obstacles are not captured, lives are lost!

// Development

First things first! Designing the UML schema for our project considering all the main features of our game and creating a git repository. We implement features one by one, working as a team or individually.
